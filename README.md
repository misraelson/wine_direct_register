This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## WINE DIRECT CASH REGISTER APP

### BUILT USING REACT AND REACTSTRAP FOR BUTTONS AND FORMS

#### ASSUMPTIONS AND APPROACH:

* Wanted to create two different input options:

1. Scanning a generic item that only had a price
2. Scanning an item that had a name and associated weight
3. Items scanned with a name and weight are then checked against an inventory that contains a name and a price per weight metric
